### Functionality dump ###

  * You don't have to place files into specific directories anymore, instead you can just dump them on UFM which'll take it from there.
  * UFM will automatically crawl through all content on a regular (possibly real-time) basis and
  * UFM will store stuff however it sees fit for itself to retrieve them later (be it iTunes style or even custom file system altogether), and
  * UFM will create an index / database of all files, using any info obtainable like: file type, date / time stamps, size, file name, metadata if present, etc. (In the case of a custom file system, this index/database would in effect be the volume's actual "file allocation table".)
  * UFM will undoubtedly need your help in clarifying/confirming many uncertainties, such as "These 2 files seem like duplicates, should I delete one?" or "Are all these MP3s really part of one album?" or "Is this person in this picture correctly identified as 'Bob'?" or "All these photos seem to be of one event, what should we call this event and when was it?" etc. As such, UFM will create a queue of such issues to be resolved, and
  * Whenever the user has time, UFM will go through these above-mentioned uncertainties with the user. This will increase the accuracy and integrity of the file store, as well as increase UFM's AI of this user's files so that better educated default-actions can be taken in the future.
  * You can search UFM for your files however you wish based on whatever criteria works best for you!
  * Another important thing would be storage management tools with flexible expandability where UFM will be able to seamlessly expand onto more drives as needed using any desired resources; internal/external storage, networked storage, and perhaps even remote storage.
